# Obstacle Dodge (2.5D Runner)

---

This repository contains the code and assets for the game "**Obstacle Dodge**," a **2.5D runner** developed with **Unity**.
It uses Unity's **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**.

This project started as part of the course **GameDev.tv: Complete Unity 3D Developer: Design & Develop Games in Unity 6 using C#**. Building upon the foundational concepts taught in the course, I have **personalized and significantly expanded** the project, focusing on:

* **Custom Level Design:** I've crafted a unique and intricate course featuring curves, narrow passages, specifically designed to challenge players.
* **2.5D Movement:** Control of a character that navigates a 3D environment, but with movement restricted to a 2D plane (forward/backward and sideways), optimized for track navigation.
* **Varied Dynamic Obstacles:** Strategic implementation and placement of projectiles, rotating objects, and falling objects to create reaction and timing challenges.
* **Core Mechanics:** Includes robust collision detection and a straightforward "Game Over" state management system.
* **Lives and Restart System:** A HUD displays remaining lives. Losing them all shows a **Game Over** screen with a restart button.
* **Win Screen:** Reaching the finish line triggers a victory screen.
* **Visual and Audio Enhancements:** TBD - Planned future improvements.

### What I've Learned and Applied

* **Unity Fundamentals:** Proficient use of the Unity editor interface, manipulation of 3D objects, and effective scene organization.
* **C# Scripting:** Applied foundational programming concepts in C# for player control, obstacle logic, and managing game states.
* **Level Design Principles:** Utilized core level design principles to create a challenging and cohesive course that complements the specific 2.5D movement style.
* **Physics and Collision Management:** Configured and utilized Unity's colliders and rigidbodies for realistic object interaction and collision detection.

### How to Play

Use the arrow keys or WASD to move your character forward, backward, left or right. Navigate the track while dodging obstacles and reach the finish without losing all your lives.

**Important Note:** This project serves as a clear demonstration of my ability to assimilate knowledge from high-quality educational resources like GameDev.tv. Crucially, it highlights my capacity to apply my own creativity and design skills to extend beyond the initial tutorial, resulting in a personalized and unique game experience. This marks a fundamental step in my journey to become a game developer.
